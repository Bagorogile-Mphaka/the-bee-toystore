    <b><h1> THE DAY I GAVE BIRTH</h1></b>
<!-- This the first paragraph -->
   <p> On <i>Thursday</i>, 10 January 2019, I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. I have wanted a baby for so long and it finally happened! <em>I was now a new mom!</em>. He was the most cutest little baby I had ever seen. I gave birth via <sub>C-section</sub>.
    The pain! Oh my word, the pain! Everybody thinks a c-section is easy and painless, but it's not! They gave me this very long injection that they put in my lower back to paralyse my lower body. It was so painful! I couldnt walk for a few days after that. He is now a <sup>very</sup> naughty three year old that loves to irritate me and give me lots of kisses.  </p>
